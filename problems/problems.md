## <a name="search-insert-position">Search Insert Position (medium)</a>

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index
if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were
inserted in order

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 5

Example 2:

Input nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
